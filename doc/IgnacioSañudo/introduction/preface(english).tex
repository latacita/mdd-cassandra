\cdpchapter{Preface}

Certain high demand applications accessible via internet like Twitter or Amazon, have very specific requirements that are complex to meet using traditional relational databases.
To resolve this problem have appeared in the last few years technologies of data storage known as NoSQL.
However, these technologies have appeared at the implementation level, still not possible to build non-relational systems from high-level conceptual models, as has been done for relational systems for decades.

The objective of this project is create a tool using modern techniques known as Model-Driven Development, this tool must transform a conceptual data model expressed in high-level (UML 2.0) in a data repository for a NoSQL storage system data. Specifically, we will use the data system based on columns called Cassandra.
